> "In Javascript, everything is an object."

This is false, everything can behave like an
object, but there are, in fact, types
that are not objects.

[Spec](https://262.ecma-international.org/10.0/#sec-ecmascript-data-types-and-values)

We've got the following primitive types:

1. undefined
2. null
3. string
4. number
5. boolean
6. symbol
7. bigint

In Javascript variables don't have types, values do.
Javascript is dynamically typed too, meaning that a variables can hold different
types of values.
