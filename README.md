# javascript-examples

> This repository is still a working progress.

## Intro

I plan to keep adding valuable examples on how javascript behaves and then
evolve it in something that is visually easier to interact with. Perhaps a
website made with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) or something similar.

Currently I'm just gathering knowledge and pouring it in this repository,
alongside examples.
